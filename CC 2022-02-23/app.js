// Convert number to reversed array of digits

// Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.
// Example:

// 348597 => [7,9,5,8,4,3]
// 0 => [0]

//P: Are you ever given an empty array or undefined? What then? Are you always given digits? 
//R: Whatever number was given, it is now split up into an array and the order of the numbers is reversed.
//E: if we were given 9238=> [8,3,2,9]
//                    330=> [0,3,3]  
//                    undefined => not a number
//P: make a function that takes in a number
function reverseArray(num){
    //make number a string and split that bebe
    let numArray = num.toString().split('').reverse()
    //reverse array
    return Number(...numArray)
    //make array integers again and return
} 

reverseArray(9238) //should return [8,3,2,9]
console.log(reverseArray(330),[0,3,3] )
//can't do it this way, have to use map. woof
